# Otto learnings

## Conventions

- Pure functions that touch the host (binary lookup, fs, credentials) take
  **injectable probes/deps** with host-wired defaults, so unit tests run without
  shelling out or hitting the real home dir. See `preflight.ts` (`runPreflight`
  probes) and `runner.ts`'s extracted argv builder.

## Gotchas

- The SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers in `loop.ts` call `process.exit()`, which runs
  **synchronously** and pre-empts pending promise `finally` blocks — so the
  per-stage scratch cleanup in `runner.ts`/`panel.ts` never runs on interrupt.
  Anything that must happen on the interrupt path (wake-lock release, scratch
  sweep via `cleanScratch`) has to be invoked **synchronously** in the handler
  before `process.exit()`, not deferred to a `finally`.

## Decisions

- `--print-config` prints two blocks: the resolved config, then a **preflight**
  block (`runPreflight`) diagnosing run prerequisites (claude CLI/auth, git
  workspace; gh CLI/auth only for `otto-ghafk`). It reports only — never exits
  non-zero — because the flag is a read-only diagnostic.

## Dead ends
