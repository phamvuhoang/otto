# Keep Otto Alive While AFK

Otto's `otto-afk` / `otto-ghafk` bins acquire an OS wake-lock for the lifetime of the loop so a sleeping laptop doesn't kill an overnight run. This is on by default — no flag, no manual OS recipe.

## What's automatic (Phase 1)

| OS      | Mechanism                                                                                            | Scope                                                                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Windows | long-lived `powershell` child calling `SetThreadExecutionState(ES_CONTINUOUS \| ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED)` | system sleep only — display can still dim                                                    |
| macOS   | `caffeinate -i -w <pid>`                                                                             | system sleep only; ties caffeinate's lifetime to the parent pid so a SIGKILL still cleans up |
| Linux   | `systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --mode=block sleep infinity`                                           | system sleep only                                                                            |
| WSL2    | Linux path runs (blocks WSL idle), **plus** a warning that it does not block Windows host sleep      | see caveat below                                                                             |

The wake-lock is acquired before iteration 1 and released on any exit path:

- clean completion (sentinel hit or iteration cap reached)
- thrown exception in any stage
- `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C) — process exits 130 after release
- `SIGTERM` — process exits 143 after release

## Opt out

Pass `--no-keep-alive` to skip wake-lock acquisition entirely. Useful for short interactive runs where Ctrl-C should be instant.

```bash
otto-afk --no-keep-alive "<plan>" 3
```

`--print-config` shows the current state:

```
keep-alive            on (system sleep only)
```

or:

```
keep-alive            off
```

## Per-OS notes

### Windows

No admin required. `SetThreadExecutionState` is a user-level Win32 API; the wake-lock holds for the lifetime of the `powershell` child, which is killed when the loop releases. Verify with:

```powershell
powercfg /requests
```

You should see a `SYSTEM` request while the loop is running, and no requests after it exits.

### macOS

`caffeinate -i` blocks idle system sleep but allows the display to dim/sleep — that's intentional so a battery laptop doesn't burn through the night with the screen on. Verify with:

```bash
pmset -g assertions | grep PreventUserIdleSystemSleep
```

The `-w <pid>` flag makes caffeinate self-terminate if the parent dies first, so a `kill -9` on `otto-afk` still releases the inhibitor.

### Linux

Requires `systemd-inhibit` (ships with systemd). Verify with:

```bash
systemd-inhibit --list
```

If `systemd-inhibit` is missing (minimal container, chroot, etc.), the loop logs one warning to stderr and continues without the wake-lock — it never crashes on a missing utility.

### WSL2

WSL2 is detected by sniffing `/proc/version` for `microsoft`. The Linux path still runs (and blocks WSL idle if systemd is enabled in `/etc/wsl.conf`), but **it cannot block Windows host sleep**. A one-line warning is emitted at acquisition.

If you're running overnight AFK loops from WSL2, configure the Windows power plan separately:

```powershell
powercfg /change standby-timeout-ac 0
powercfg /change standby-timeout-dc 0
```

A WSL2 → Windows host wake-lock bridge would require a Windows-side helper process; that's out of scope for v1.

## Per-stage retry (Phase 2)

Every `runStage` call is wrapped in an exponential-backoff retry. A transient failure (network blip, claude API hiccup, a brief docker daemon stall) no longer aborts the loop.

Defaults:

| Setting     | Value         |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Max retries | `3`           |
| Backoff     | `5s, 30s, 2m` |

After the retry budget is exhausted, the failing stage is **skipped** — the loop moves on to the next iteration instead of throwing out of `runLoop`. A persistent gate-stage failure simply means no sentinel was seen, so the loop keeps iterating until it hits the iteration cap.

Each retry is announced both on stderr and as a one-line marker appended to the per-stage NDJSON log:

```
[retry] attempt 1 of 3 after 5000 ms
```

Override via `--max-retries <N>` on either bin. `--max-retries 0` restores the previous fail-fast behavior (a single attempt; any failure breaks out of the current iteration's stage chain).

```bash
otto-afk --max-retries 5 "<plan>" 50    # dial up for flaky environments
otto-afk --max-retries 0 "<plan>" 1     # fail fast on a short interactive run
```

`--print-config` shows the current value:

```
max-retries           3
```

## Detach (Phase 3)

`--detach` forks the loop into the background and exits the parent immediately with code `0`. Closing the terminal, dropping SSH, or logging out of the desktop session no longer kills the loop — the child is reparented to init and keeps iterating.

```bash
otto-afk --detach "<plan>" 50
# detached pid 12345, log /path/to/workspace/.otto-tmp/logs/detached-12300.log
```

Under the hood:

- The bin re-spawns itself via `process.execPath` (the same node binary) with `--detach` and `--log` stripped from argv. The child cannot fork again — no infinite loop.
- Child stdio (stdout + stderr) is appended to the log file. Multiple runs targeting the same path concatenate cleanly rather than truncating.
- The spawn is `detached: true` + `unref()` so the parent can exit. On Windows, `windowsHide: true` keeps a console window from popping in PowerShell.
- The wake-lock + retry behavior from Phase 1 / Phase 2 still apply — they're acquired in the child, not orphaned in the parent.

### Log target

Default: `<workspace>/.otto-tmp/logs/detached-<pid>.log` (the `<pid>` is the original parent process, fixed at fork time). Override with `--log <path>`:

```bash
otto-afk --detach --log /var/log/otto-overnight.log "<plan>" 50
```

`--log` without `--detach` is rejected (it is only meaningful in detached mode).

### Reattaching

There is no reattach surface in v1. Tail the log from any shell:

```bash
tail -f /path/to/workspace/.otto-tmp/logs/detached-12300.log
```

`--print-config` shows the current state:

```
detach                off
```

or with `--detach` active:

```
detach                on (log: /path/to/workspace/.otto-tmp/logs/detached-12300.log)
```

## Notify (Phase 4)

`--notify` opts into a best-effort OS notification + terminal bell on every terminal event:

- **Clean completion** — sentinel hit or iteration cap reached → `info`-level notification.
- **Unrecoverable failure** — uncaught exception, `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C), or `SIGTERM` during a run → `error`-level notification.

Calls are fire-and-forget: the loop never blocks on toast delivery, and a missing OS utility never crashes. A terminal bell (`\x07`) is written to stderr on every notification regardless of OS path, so even a headless terminal with no toast surface still gets an audible signal.

| OS      | Mechanism                                                                      | Fallback                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Windows | `powershell` → `New-BurntToastNotification` (if BurntToast installed)          | `msg.exe * "<title>: <body>"` → bell-only |
| macOS   | `osascript -e 'display notification … sound name "Glass"'` (`Basso` for error) | bell-only                                 |
| Linux   | `notify-send --urgency normal` (or `critical` for error)                       | bell-only                                 |

```bash
otto-afk --notify "<plan>" 50
```

### Windows: BurntToast (optional)

For real Windows 10/11 toasts install the BurntToast PowerShell module once:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name BurntToast -Force
```

Without it, the bin falls through to `msg.exe` (a console message dialog), and then to bell-only if `msg.exe` is missing too (Windows Home does not ship it).

### macOS

No setup needed — `osascript` is built in. Notifications appear in the Notification Center; the sound name is `Glass` for `info` and `Basso` for `error`.

### Linux

Requires `libnotify` (`notify-send`). Most desktop distros ship it; on headless servers install `libnotify-bin` (Debian/Ubuntu) or rely on the bell.

`--print-config` shows the current state:

```
notify                on
```

or:

```
notify                off
```

## Out of scope (v1)

- **Power-loss / battery-death** — a dead battery kills the loop. Use a UPS if you care about overnight resilience to power events.
- **Resume on restart** — if the host reboots, the loop does not auto-resume from iteration N+1. The git commits the loop has already produced are the practical resume mechanism.
- **WSL2 → Windows host wake-lock bridge** — see WSL2 section above. Run natively on Windows for AFK use, or set the Windows power plan manually.
- **Notification rich-actions / grouping** — plain title + body + bell only. No clickable actions, no Notification Center categorization, no mid-loop progress toasts.

## Canonical overnight recipe

```bash
otto-afk --detach --notify "<plan-and-prd>" 50
```

- `--detach` forks the loop into the background so you can close the terminal.
- `--notify` raises an OS toast + bell when the run finishes (or fails).
- Wake-lock and 3× retry are on by default — no flags needed.
- Default log: `<workspace>/.otto-tmp/logs/detached-<pid>.log` (override with `--log`).
